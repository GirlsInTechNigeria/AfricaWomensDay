      <p>Gender Discrimination at the workplace: How common is it?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mainBody">
      <div class="content">
        <h4>
          <strong>
            Gender discrimination in the workplace still remains a real and rife
            issue, with many women experiencing sexual harassment, job
            insecurity and lower pay compared with their male colleagues.
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          Discrimination is described as a social phenomenon in which factors
          such as gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and race are
          used to make distinctions towards people. Women face gender
          discrimination in everyday life and unfortunately, in the workplace.
          Gender discrimination has various forms such as the gender pay gap,
          lack of career progression for women, gender stereotyping for
          executive roles, and sexual harassment. Moreover, it often leads
          towards mental health problems in women affecting them long term such
          as PTSD. We explore what discrimination looks like and what steps can
          be taken to prohibit such behaviour.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          <strong>Some examples of gender discrimination include:</strong>
        </h4>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>
            not being hired or being given a lower-paying position because of
            your gender or sexual orientation (for example, when an employer
            refuses to hire women, or only hires women for certain jobs).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            being held to different or higher standards, or being evaluated more
            harshly, because of your gender identity, or because you don’t act
            or present yourself in a way that conforms to traditional ideas of
            femininity. This often results in unnecessary pressure and scrutiny
            being placed on the individual based on their gender.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            being paid less than a person of a different gender who is similarly
            or less qualified than you, or who has similar job duties than you.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            being denied a promotion, pay raise, or training opportunity that is
            given to people of another gender identity or sexual orientation who
            are equally or less qualified or as you.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            being insulted, called derogatory names or slurs because of your
            gender, or hearing hostile remarks about people of a certain gender
            identity because of power misuse in the workplace.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            being rejected for a job, forced out on leave, or given fewer
            assignments because you’re pregnant. All the above are clear and
            current problems arising in the workplace as a result of
            discrimination. These types of misconduct are covered by the
            Equality Act 2010 and the Civil Rights Act 1964.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          <strong> Statistics and what they mean:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Current research released by the Young Women’s Trust shows that over
          62% of young women say that their future prospects have got worse over
          the last six months due to gender discrimination in the workplace.
          Moreover, the Office for National Statistics found that the median
          hourly pay for full-time employees was 8.3% less for women than for
          men in 2022, while the median hourly pay for part-time employees was
          2.8% higher for women than for men. These are incredible figures
          highlighting a true imbalance not just a small disparity.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h4>
          <strong>What can be done to stop gender discrimination?</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Over the years the laws have been improved and we have also witnessed
          many companies actively taking steps to end this behaviour & the
          reporting rules on salaries are being extended to flag the issues and
          shine a spotlight on those creating these gaps. However, we know we
          have a ways to go and how we do this needs to radically change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol class="content-list">
          <li>
            Men need to feel comfortable asking for parental leave and
            part-time/flexible working if they are to share parenting & allow
            women to return to work.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Child care needs to be accessible and affordable for everyone.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Policies and processes will be required to be changed by law, but
            employers need to not only do this but train their management and HR
            and encourage a culture to embrace the policies in place.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Encouraging staff to talk openly and not be afraid to discuss health
            and homelife issues is essential as part of this growing wellbeing
            and welfare culture needed in the workplace.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Reporting pay gaps and salaries on recruitment materials we hope
            will increase transparency which will assist us to reduce the gaps,
            but this will only happen if everyone is on the same page as
            salaries can be adapted by bonuses and other benefits which may be
            hidden, promotions, board diversity it is all needed and we need to
            move quicker in how we process diversity.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            However, this must be done right – no woman wants to be promoted
            only because it fits the diversity model – they want training,
            genuine career progression, challenges and respect the same as
            anyone so the entire outlook must be genuine too.
          </li>
          <br />
        </ol>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          We strongly encourage employers to check in on staff by having regular
          one-to-one meetings, provide full training for members of HR so they
          can be fully prepared in the event such discrimination happens and
          carry out a risk assessment on the business. The faster they react;
          the stronger they react and the better change we have.
        </p>

          <li>
            Create a log of all incidents that have occurred being as detailed
            and specific as possible.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In the first instance speak to your line manager and ask for support
            and advice. If that doesn’t work or they are the one causing the
            issues to speak to HR or a trusted manager.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            If no affirmative action is taken you need to consider raising a
            formal written grievance with your company and speak to your line
            manager, HR and all relevant parties. They have then a duty to
            investigate, interview parties and provide you with an outcome and
            hopefully positive steps to resolve the matter.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In the event that nothing is resolved, it is recommended that you
            seek legal advice. As it maybe you need to escalate the matter or
            even consider constructive dismissal.

            >A City Law Firm</a
          >, we specialise in all types of discrimination claims and we are
          dedicated to achieving the best result and outcome for your case.
          Whether that be a settlement agreement or going to a tribunal. We know
          raising a grievance isn’t the first option you may wish to consider,
          we know leaving your career could be damaging and we know tribunal
          claims are costly. We would work with you to support whatever decision
          and approach you wish to take, but often having someone on your side
          gives you the confidence to stand up and shout out Maintaining a
          strong HR department can also work as a deterrent and lessen incidents
          of harassment. One way to do this is to employ a diversity and
          inclusion advisor who would be able to provide internal insight into
          policies and practices to ensure they are not discriminatory.
