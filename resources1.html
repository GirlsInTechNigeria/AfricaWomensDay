            HOW TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION <br />
            IN THE WORKPLACE
          </h1>

          <h4><u>Article by Meena Chander, founder of Events Together and the  This is Us conference</u>
          </h4>


          <p>The term discrimination refers to the mistreatment of individuals based on the prejudices regarding their attributes, beliefs, and culture, including age, race, disability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and nationality.</p>


          <p>Discrimination is serious matter, and it can have a detrimental effect on an employee's mental
              well-beign
              and self-esteem, and in some cases,
              it may even hinder their career progression.
          </p>

          <p>To tackle this, discrimination in the workplace must be dealt with promptly and in a professsional
              manner.
              This article will discuss the ways
              in which incidents of discrimination can occur, and to efficiently address and eliminate these
              occurrences.
          </p>

          <h3>Types of discrimination in the workplace</h3>

          <p>The most obvious type of discrimination is known as 'direct discrimination', which is when a person
              is
              treated less favourably because is a
              social construct, such as their sexuality, ethnicity or gender. Direct discrimination can manifest
              itself
              in the workplace through various channels,
              For instance, if a woman misses out in a well-deserved promotion and their less qualified male
              counterpart
              secures the job, this can be deemed as
              a form of direct discrimination. <br>
              Indirect discrimination, on the other hand is concerned with acts and policies that put certain
              individuals
              at a disadvantage. For example, if
              a dress is fitting shop exclusively only hired females on the basis that male shop assistants may
              make
              female customers feel uncomfortable during
              fittings, then this policy would be exclusionary and be considered as indirect discrimination
              against
              males.
          </p>


          <p>
              In most cases, indirect discrimination is not meant to be intentional, however, these policies are
              still
              exclusionary.
          </p>

          <p>Other forms of discrimination include harassment, which consist of:
            <ul>
              <li>Derogatory remarks regarding a person based on their individual identifiers</li>
              <li>Creating a hostile working environment</li>
              <li>Unwanted sexual advances</li>
            </ul>
          </p>



          <p>These types of discrimination are perhaps the most troubling and obvious forms, but there are ways
              in which
              the workplace can eradicate
              them immediately:
          </p>

          <h3>Have a strict anti-discriminatory policy</h3>

          <p>It's a UK legal requirement to have in place an anti-discriminatory policy, that defines the
              different forms
              of discrimination, setout roles
              and responsibilities and explains the consequences of discrimination.
          </p>

          <p>If a discriminatory incident occurs, the anti-discriminatory policy will provide a clear framework
              that HR
              professinals can follow to efficiently
              deal with situation. As a result, the discriminated party can feel satisfied that the occurrence has
              been
              dealt with promptly and professsionally.
          </p>

          <h3>Prevent recruitment bias</h3>

          <p>
              Recruitment bias refers to when a recruiter develops an opinion about a potential hire
              due to characteristics such a their name, birthplace, or other factors. One example of recruitment
              bias is
              where a recruiter feels less inclined to hire
              someone based on social compatability, where they would not socialise with the potential hire,
              outside of
              work.These types of attitude
              can be detrimental when it comes to recruiting a diverse workforce.
          </p>

          <p>The best way to eliminate recruitment bias is to create diversity within the HR department, as a
              diverse
              team ensures visibility and relatability
              when recruiting new hires.
          </p>

          <p>Another good resource for recruitment is to utilise D&I to headhunt talent from underrepresented
              groups. This
              not only ensures that the company's
              talent pool is inclusive of people from various backgrounds, but can also help to minimise
              discrimination company-wide.
          </p>

          <h3>Review training policies</h3>
          <p>Using trainig policies are a way of instilling information into employees and providing them with
              the
              necessary skills to ensure they work well with
              colleagues. Diversity training should be an intergral part of any company training programme as it
              can help
              to eradicate unconscious bias, and
              prejudice that an employee may have before they start their new job. Diversity training is also
              essential
              for those who work in managerial
              positions - eradicating any unconscious bias from management, which could negatively impact
              employees'
              performance and well-being.
          </p>

          <h3>Have a HR point of contact</h3>
          <p>If an accident does occur, it is essential that every employee has a point of contact within the HR
              department so that they can express
              any concerns and report any incidents that may have occured. HR provides a point of safety for all
              employees and follows a clear framework to
              investigate and deal with discriminatory incident promptly.
          </p>

          <p>Maintaining a strong HR department can also work as a deterrent and lessen incidents of harassment.
              One way
              to do this is to employ a diversity
              and inclusion advisor who would be able to provide internal insight into policies and practices to
              ensure
              the are not discriminatory.
          </p>

          <h3>Attend events</h3>

          <p>D&I events are fantastic way to expose staff to a range of concepts and keep them up to date with
              the latest
              news and insights from
              the industry. Events can play an important role in networking and give a team an opportunity to
              meet a
              diverse range of industry
              professionals and people from all backgrounds, which can inspire new company practices, fresh ways
              of
              thinking and much more.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>These steps are relatively simple; however, they can make a significant difference when it comes to
              tackling
              workplace discrimination. Not only
              should they eliminate incidents of discrimination, but this framework also works towards ensuring
              all teams
              members are happy and thriving.
